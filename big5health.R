# load in the data
ipip <- read_csv('ipip50_sample.csv')

# This dataset includes measures of the Big 5 Inventory personality index, which
# measures traits of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, 
# Neuroticism, and Openness, along with measures of age, BMI, and exercise 
# habits for 1000 participants. 
# 
# In the dataset, each trait has a set of associated survey items (e.g., 
# Agreeableness has A_1, A_2, A_3, ... A_10). The total number of  items 
# vary for the different traits (e.g., Agreeableness has 10, but Openness only 
# has 2). For each participant, there are measures for each of the items as well
# as the participant's age, BMI, gender, and exercise habits which are 
# categorically coded in terms of frequency.
#
# In this PS, we want to look at the relationship between the big 5 and age, 
# gender, BMI, and exercise habits. To do so will require some data wrangling...

# Calculate composites of the big 5 ---------------------------------------

# Composites for the big 5 are based on the average value of their multiple 
# items. For example, an Agreeableness composite would be the average of items
# A_1 through A_10. We want to calculate these averages for each trait 
# separately for each participant. Do this by filling in the steps below:

# The data is in wide format (i.e., each row is separate participant with
# columns for different measures) and we need it in long format. Convert
# to long format with a gather command on the trait items (A_1...O_10):
# **HINT: The long format data set should have 42000 rows**

ipip.l <- ipip %>% 
  gather("A_1":"O_10", # gather columns between A_1 and O_10, and include A_1 and O_10
         key=trait_item,value=index_score)

# We need a column that identifies rows as belonging to a specific trait,
# but the column you created based on the trait items includes both trait
# and item (e.g., A_1, but we want A in a separate column from item 1).
# Make this happen with a separate command:
ipip.l <- ipip.l %>% separate(trait_item,into=c('trait','item'),sep="_")

# Calculate averages for each participant (coded as RID) and trait:
ipip.comp <- ipip.l %>% group_by(RID, trait) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_index_score = mean(index_score)
  )
    
# Cleaning up the other variables -----------------------------------------

# Depending on how you solved the above steps, your ipip.comp ttibble may or may
# not have the age, gender, exer, BMI variables that we want to compare to the big 5. If
# they are missing, let's add them in by joining the original ipip tibble with
# ipip.comp tibble:
# HINT: use a select call on ipip to only select the columns that you want to
# merge with ipip.comp
ipip.comp <- ipip %>% select("RID":"exer") %>% left_join(ipip.comp)
  
# One last thing, our exercise variable is all out of order. Because it was read
# in as a character string, it is in alphabetical order. Let's turn it into a 
# factor and reorder the levels according to increasing frequency. Do this by 
# using the factor command and its levels argument:
ipip.comp$exer <- factor(ipip.comp$exer,
                         levels = c("veryRarelyNever", 
                                    "less1mo",
                                    "less1wk",
                                    "1or2wk",
                                    "3or5wk",
                                    "more5wk"))

# Analyze the data! -------------------------------------------------------

# Summarise the trait values across the different levels of exercise habits. 
# Calculate both the mean (use the new variable name 'avg') and standard error
# of the mean (i.e., standard deviation divided by the square root of the 
# number of participants; use variable name 'sem'):
